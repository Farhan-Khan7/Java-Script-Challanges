// PHASE 0 CHALLANGE 1 

// You and your friend are baking cupcakes for a party. You've filled up two trays, each with a certain number of cupcakes. You want to know the total number of cupcakes you have before you frost them.

// Challenge

// Create a function that adds two numbers (representing cupcakes on each tray) and returns the total.

// You just need to implement the totalCupcakes function

function totalCupcakes(trayOne, trayTwo) {
    // Return the sum of trayOne and trayTwo
    return trayOne + trayTwo;
    
}
console.log(totalCupcakes(12 , 20))  



// You have a basket of apples, but you decide to give some away to your neighbor. How many apples are left in your basket?

// Challenge

// Write a function that subtracts the number of apples given away from the total apples you started with, then returns the remaining apples.

// Your code starts here
// You just need to implement the totalChocolateBars function

// Your code starts here
// You just need to implement the remainingApples function
function remainingApples(totalApples, givenAway) {
    // Return totalApples minus givenAway
    return totalApples - givenAway ;
    
  }
console.log(remainingApples(50 , 10));  


// You're packing chocolate bars into gift boxes. Each box must contain the same number of chocolate bars. How many chocolate bars do you need for all the boxes?

// Challenge

// Create a function that multiplies two numbers (chocolate bars per box and number of boxes) and retums the total number of chocolate bars needed.


// Your code starts here
// You just need to implement the totalChocolateBars function
function totalChocolateBars(barsPerBox, numberOfBoxes) {
    // Return barsPerBox multiplied by numberOfBoxes
    return barsPerBox * numberOfBoxes;
    
  }
console.log(totalChocolateBars(5 , 10));
